				<p>Boasting an acknowledged successful track-record in artist, band & producer management,  record
					label, agency and sync acquisition, it seemed like a natural evolution to
					bring all of the skills, contacts and experience together to create a truly fresh and dynamic publishing
					company to serve both new as well as established artists.</p>
				<br>
				<p>With an existing pedigree for music
					placements on various films, TV shows, adverts, computer games (and even hotel lobbies!),
					Beautiful World Music are proud to be boutique and passionate enough to know every song and
					snippet of music in the catalogue, yet big and experienced enough to compete with any of the major
					players.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“Having already secured tracks in universal blockbusters, such as Captain Marvel with Republica; Shrek with the Baha Men; TV series placements from Sons Of Anarchy with Damien Dempsey to Come Dine With Me with The
					Wonder Stuff, along
					with numerous TV commercials including Mitsubishi and Irish Ferries with Raglans, we are fully aware how some of the bigger publishers will often not even realise who is on the roster and miss potential
					opportunities.  Beautiful World
					Music strives to ensure that every piece of music under its roof is given the audience exposure that it deserves.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“We have always prided ourselves on being an artist friendly company” says director Tom Haxell “and we have a proven track record for placing songs in films etc, but nowadays we are focusing even more of our time and
					resources on
					getting synchs, further placements and usages for our wonderful array of songs. We have new colleagues joining us and are very excited for the future as well as building a department focusing on assisting artists al
					all stages of their
					careers getting on various streaming playlists”</p>
				<br>
				<p>David Jaymes, commenting on the signing, said “we are absolutely delighted to have the opportunity represent Padraig Jack, whose talent and creativity struck me from my first hearing of his work. His mix of Gaelic and
					English lyrics,
					cleverly woven into trad and contemporary sounds has resulted in an album of enormous potential”.</p>
